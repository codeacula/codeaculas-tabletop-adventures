# Community Guidelines

Welcome to Codeacula's Tabletop Adventures! Whether you're here to sling code, spin tales, or roll virtual dice, we're glad you're part of the journey.

This document outlines how we engage with each other. It's not just rules - it's about values, intent, and building a space worth belonging to.
