# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

This is a space for creativity, curiosity, and community. Whether you're here to contribute code, share an idea, or just observe - we welcome you with respect and care. We're not here to gatekeep. We're here to grow, together.

We hold space for neurodivergence, queerness, gender expansiveness, disability, trauma, recovery, and the deep messiness of being human. Your safety and dignity matter here.

## We Stand For

- Respect: Treat others with care, especially when you disagree.
- Equity: Advocate for voices and perspectives historically marginalized in tech.
- Curiosity: Ask questions. Explain things without condescension.
- Accountability: Own your impact. Repair harm.

## We Do Not Allow

- Harassment, hate speech, or personal attacks
- Dismissing lived experience or identity
- Gatekeeping or shaming others for what they don't know
- Bigotry of any kind (including racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism)

## Reporting Harm

If you see something harmful or experience behavior that doesn't align with these values, please let us know.

- You can message @codeacula privately on Discord
- Or open an issue and mark it confidential

We'll take it seriously and respond with care - not performative punishment.

## Borrowed Backbone

This Code of Conduct is rooted in the Contributor Covenant v2.1 and adapted with intention to reflect the heart of this community:
